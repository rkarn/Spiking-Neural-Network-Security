# In this code, generate_bitstream function generates a bitstream with a given probability of '1â€™s. stochastic_multiply function performs the multiplication operation using an AND gate, which is simulated by the bitwise AND operator &.
# Please note that the accuracy of this function increases with the length of the bitstream. So, you might need to increase the bitstream length for more accurate results.
