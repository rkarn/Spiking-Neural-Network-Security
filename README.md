## Spiking Neural Network Security and Challenges in FPGA Implementation

The report containins the security considerations of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). 
The mathematical aspects as throughly examined, discussed the challenges associated with the threat model, and computational complexity. 
Also, put forward a potential solution. 

For reader: Feel free to skip the section 1 (the first two pages) as it primarily covers the background of SNN.

A sample stochastic computing code is given in `stochastic_computing.py` file.

A feed-forward neural network for MNIST dataset is given in `Neural Network with Stochastic Computing.ipynb` where `stochastic computing` is employed in the inference.  Error occured. 

More details to follow.
