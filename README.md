## Spiking Neural Network Security and Challenges in FPGA Implementation

The report containins the security considerations of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). 
The mathematical aspects as throughly examined, discussed the challenges associated with the threat model, and computational complexity. 
Also, put forward a potential solution. 

For reader: Feel free to skip the section 1 (the first two pages) as it primarily covers the background of SNN.

More details to follow.
